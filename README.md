# Dental Clinic Website

This project is a responsive and modern website for a dental clinic, showcasing its services, contact details, and clinic information. The website is built using React and adheres to a structured component-based architecture. It also demonstrates form validation and interaction using placeholder APIs.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each section of the website (e.g., Contact Form, Services, etc.) is built as a reusable React component.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **Form Validation**: Used `zod` to validate user input on the contact form, ensuring data integrity.
- **Axios Integration**: Incorporated `axios` for sending form data to a placeholder API (no backend connected).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Form Validation**: Zod

## Usage

### Adding Services

* Update the `services` array in the `ServicesList` component to add or modify the services displayed.

### Placeholder Form Handling

* The contact form currently sends data to a placeholder using `axios`. You can replace the placeholder URL with your API endpoint when integrating with a backend.

---

## Validation with Zod

The form in the `ContactForm` component uses Zod for validation:

* All fields are validated to ensure proper input.
* Error messages are displayed dynamically based on validation results.

---

## Future Enhancements

* **Backend Integration**: Add backend APIs for handling form submissions and dynamic data.
* **CMS Integration**: Integrate with a CMS to make content management easier for non-technical users.
* **Additional Features**: Add appointment booking, user authentication, and more.
